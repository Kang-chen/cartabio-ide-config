# Refactor Workflow

When refactoring code, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze** the current code structure
2. **Identify** code smells and improvement areas
3. **Plan** the refactoring approach
4. **Execute** changes incrementally
5. **Verify** functionality after each change
6. **Document** significant changes
