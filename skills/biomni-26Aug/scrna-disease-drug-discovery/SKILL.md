# scRNA-seq Disease Drug Discovery Pipeline

Identify and prioritize drug targets from disease scRNA-seq data by integrating transcriptomic evidence (differential expression, pathway enrichment, ligand-receptor interactions) with human genetic evidence (Open Targets GWAS/ClinVar, GeneBass rare variant burden, TWAS, eQTL). Targets with convergent multi-omics evidence receive the highest priority.

## When to Use This Skill

- **You have scRNA-seq data from a disease vs. control comparison** and want therapeutic targets
- **You want multi-omics target prioritization** combining expression + genetic evidence
- **You need cell-type-resolved drug discovery insights** (which cell types drive disease?)
- **You want to identify druggable targets** with convergent transcriptomic and genetic support

**Chains from** `scrnaseq-scanpy-core-analysis` output (`adata_processed.h5ad`) or accepts raw data.

**Don't use for:**
- Cell type annotation only (use `scrnaseq-scanpy-core-analysis`)
- Genetic-only target discovery (use `genetic-target-hypothesis`)
- Gene regulatory networks (use `grn-pyscenic`)
- Spatial transcriptomics (use `spatial-transcriptomics`)

## Quick Start (Demo Data)

**Test the full pipeline on SSc demo data (~20-40 min including API queries):**

```python
# Load demo dataset (GSE195452 SSc skin biopsies)
from load_data import load_demo_ssc_data
adata = load_demo_ssc_data()

# Run full pipeline
from pseudobulk_de import run_pseudobulk_de, get_disease_signature_genes
de_results = run_pseudobulk_de(adata, reference="Healthy", layer="counts")

from pathway_enrichment import run_pathway_analysis
pathway_results = run_pathway_analysis(adata, de_results)

from ligand_receptor import run_lr_analysis
lr_results = run_lr_analysis(adata)

sig_genes = get_disease_signature_genes(de_results)
candidate_genes = list(set(g for genes in sig_genes.values() for g in genes))[:200]

from genetic_evidence import collect_genetic_evidence
genetic_results = collect_genetic_evidence(candidate_genes, "systemic sclerosis")

from query_opentargets import query_target_annotations
ot_annotations = query_target_annotations(candidate_genes[:50])

from target_scoring import score_targets
scores = score_targets(de_results, pathway_results, lr_results, genetic_results, ot_annotations)

from generate_visualizations import generate_all_plots
generate_all_plots(adata, de_results, pathway_results, lr_results, genetic_results, scores)

from export_results import export_all
export_all(adata, de_results, pathway_results, lr_results, genetic_results, scores, ot_annotations)
```

**What you get:**
- **Dataset:** 277K cells from 165 SSc + healthy skin biopsies (subsampled for compute)
- **Expected results:** 100-700 DEGs across fibroblast subtypes, TGF-beta/ECM/IFN pathway enrichment, 15+ MEDIUM/HIGH priority targets with convergent genetic + transcriptomic evidence
- **Outputs:** ranked_targets.csv, 7+ PNG/SVG visualizations, per-cell-type DE CSVs, GSEA results, L-R interactions, genetic evidence summary, analysis_manifest.json

## Report Packaging

When the user requests a PDF report, run the analysis first, then load and use
the Biomni `pdf-report-generation` skill for the final PDF deliverable. Build
the PDF from this skill's markdown summary, result tables, and generated figures,
and save it using the PDF filename listed in Outputs, or a stable descriptive filename when Outputs does not define one.

Keep this skill focused on scientific workflow and artifact content. Do not add
custom figure appearance or report layout instructions here; those are handled
by the platform prompt and dedicated reporting skills. If `pdf-report-generation`
is unavailable, use the packaged markdown/HTML/script fallback when present and
clearly disclose the fallback.

## Decision Guide

| Decision | Quick Guide | Reference |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Data type** | 10X Chromium (default). Smart-seq2/plate: lower min_cells to 3-5 | [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) |
| **Subsampling** | >50K cells: subsample to 2-5K per cell type per condition. Do NOT use flat global cap | [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) |
| **DE layer** | Always pass `layer="counts"` if .X is log-normalized. Auto-detected if layers["counts"] exists | [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) |
| **GSEA ranking** | Combined stat sign(LFC) x -log10(padj) (default). Skips cell types with failed DE | [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) |
| **Genetic evidence** | Open Targets GWAS/ClinVar is primary; GeneBass if disease is in UKB; TWAS/eQTL supplementary | [references/genetic_evidence_guide.md](references/genetic_evidence_guide.md) |
| **Analysis scope** | Full pipeline (default). Transcriptomics-only if no genetic evidence needed | Below |

## Clarification Questions

**Default settings (use unless user specifies otherwise):**
- Species: Human | Genetic evidence: Enabled | All analyses: Enabled

### 1. **Input Files** (ASK THIS FIRST):
   - Do you have an annotated scRNA-seq AnnData (.h5ad) with disease and control conditions?
   - **Or use demo data?** GSE195452: Systemic sclerosis skin biopsies (SSc + healthy controls)
   - If your own data: provide path to .h5ad file

### 2. **Metadata columns** (own data only):
   - Which column contains cell type labels? (default: `cell_type`)
   - Which column contains disease/condition labels? (default: `condition`)
   - Which column contains sample/donor IDs? (default: `sample_id`)

### 3. **Disease context** (own data only):
   - What disease are you studying? (needed for Open Targets genetic evidence and pathway context)
   - Species: Human (default) or Mouse?

### 4. **Analysis scope:**
   - a) Full pipeline with genetic evidence (recommended)
   - b) Transcriptomics only (DE + pathways + L-R, no genetic evidence)
   - c) Custom: specify which analyses

> :warning: **IF DEMO DATA SELECTED:** All parameters are pre-defined (SSc, human, full pipeline). **DO NOT ask questions 2-4.** Proceed directly to Step 1.

## Data Integrity Rules

:rotating_light: **NEVER reconstruct results from memory, notes, or session summaries.** :rotating_light:

If you cannot find the expected output CSV files after a crash or restart:
1. **STOP immediately** -- do NOT type quantitative values from memory
2. Check standard locations: `results/`, `./results/`, `/mnt/results/`, the working directory
3. Each analysis step saves CSVs incrementally (DE per cell type, GSEA per cell type, ranked_targets.csv) -- check for partial results
4. If files are truly missing, **re-run the analysis step** from the saved h5ad
5. **NEVER** hardcode target data like `[('GENE1', 0.82, 'HIGH'), ...]` from session notes

**Every quantitative value in the final report must be read from a CSV file on disk, not from session memory.**

**If the session crashed (OOM, kernel restart):** Partial CSVs from completed steps are on disk. Re-run only the steps that didn't complete. The h5ad file is the checkpoint -- all analysis can be re-derived from it.

## Standard Workflow

:rotating_light: **MANDATORY: USE SCRIPTS EXACTLY AS SHOWN - DO NOT WRITE INLINE CODE** :rotating_light:

**Detailed step-by-step code:** [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md)

**CRITICAL - DO NOT:**
- Write inline analysis code -- **STOP: Use the script functions**
- Write custom export code -- **STOP: Use `export_all()`**
- Skip verification messages -- **STOP: Check for verification messages after each step**
- Reconstruct values from memory after a crash -- **STOP: Read from saved CSVs or re-run**

**IF SCRIPTS FAIL - Script Failure Hierarchy:**
1. **Fix and Retry (90%)** - Install missing package, re-run script
2. **Modify Script (5%)** - Edit the script file itself, document changes
3. **Use as Reference (4%)** - Read script, adapt approach, cite source
4. **Write from Scratch (1%)** - Only if genuinely impossible, explain why

**NEVER skip directly to writing inline code without trying the script first.**

---

**Step 1 -- Load and validate data:**
```python
# Option A: Demo data (GSE195452 SSc)
from load_data import load_demo_ssc_data
adata = load_demo_ssc_data()

# Option B: Pre-annotated h5ad
from load_data import load_annotated_h5ad
adata = load_annotated_h5ad("path/to/adata.h5ad",
                             celltype_key="cell_type",
                             condition_key="condition",
                             sample_key="sample_id")

# Option C: Raw data (will preprocess)
from load_data import load_raw_data
from preprocess import run_preprocessing_pipeline
adata = load_raw_data("path/to/data")
adata = run_preprocessing_pipeline(adata, species="human")

# CHECKPOINT: Save AnnData to disk immediately (OOM/timeout resilience)
# If the kernel restarts, reload from this file instead of rebuilding.
adata.write_h5ad("results/adata_processed.h5ad")
print("Checkpoint saved: results/adata_processed.h5ad")
```
**DO NOT write inline data loading code.**
**CHECKPOINT:** After loading, ALWAYS save the AnnData to disk. If the kernel restarts later, reload with `sc.read_h5ad("results/adata_processed.h5ad")` instead of re-downloading and rebuilding from GEO.

**VERIFICATION:** You MUST see: `"Data loaded successfully! N cells, M genes, K cell types, C conditions"`
**If you don't see this:** Check file path, verify .h5ad has required metadata columns (cell_type, condition, sample_id).

---

**Step 2 -- Run analysis:**

**Sample selection:** Use ALL available samples — statistical power depends on biological replicates, not cell count. Subsample CELLS within samples if needed for memory, but do NOT drop samples. For datasets with >100K cells, subsample to ~3000-5000 cells per cell type per condition while keeping all samples represented. For plate-based data (Smart-seq2), use patient_id (not amplification batch) as the pseudobulk grouping variable. See [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) for details.

**GSEA thresholds:** GSEA output tables report all pathways with FDR < 0.25 (standard for GSEA reporting and exploration). Target scoring uses stricter FDR < 0.05 for pathway_score contribution. Both thresholds are intentional.

```python
# 2a. Differential expression (disease vs control per cell type)
# IMPORTANT: pass layer="counts" if adata.X is log-normalized
from pseudobulk_de import run_pseudobulk_de, get_disease_signature_genes
de_results = run_pseudobulk_de(adata,
                                condition_key="condition",
                                sample_key="sample_id",
                                celltype_key="cell_type",
                                reference="Healthy",
                                layer="counts")

# 2b. Pathway enrichment (uses combined ranking: sign(LFC) x -log10(padj))
from pathway_enrichment import run_pathway_analysis
pathway_results = run_pathway_analysis(adata, de_results, species="human")

# 2c. Ligand-receptor interactions
# Auto-merges to max 20 cell types, subsamples to 2000 cells/type, 100 permutations
# for tractable runtime (~5-10 min). Increase n_perms for more stable estimates.
from ligand_receptor import run_lr_analysis
lr_results = run_lr_analysis(adata,
                              celltype_key="cell_type",
                              condition_key="condition",
                              max_celltypes=20,
                              max_cells_per_type=2000,
                              n_perms=100)

# 2d. Collect candidate gene list from DE results (for genetic + OT queries)
sig_genes = get_disease_signature_genes(de_results, padj_threshold=0.05, log2fc_threshold=0.25)
candidate_genes = list(set(g for genes in sig_genes.values() for g in genes))[:200]

# 2e. Genetic evidence (queries Open Targets GWAS/ClinVar + TWAS + eQTL + L2G)
from genetic_evidence import collect_genetic_evidence
genetic_results = collect_genetic_evidence(
    gene_list=candidate_genes,
    disease_name="systemic sclerosis",
    include_genebass=True)

# 2f. Target scoring
# CRITICAL: Use score_targets_simple() — DO NOT write custom scoring code.
# Custom scorers miss: convergence bonus, cross-compartment L-R bridging,
# adaptive reweighting, NES-weighted pathway scoring, and DE cap logic.
from target_scoring import score_targets_simple
scores = score_targets_simple({
    "de": de_results,
    "pathway": pathway_results,
    "lr": lr_results,
    "genetic": genetic_results,
})
# Druggability auto-queried for top 20 genes. For all: pass "ot_annotations" key.

# 2g. GWAS Gene Landscape (MANDATORY for SSc demo)
# Maps top SSc GWAS genes to their cell-type expression context.
# Separate from the DE-derived target list — bridges immune-fibroblast disconnect.
from genetic_evidence import get_top_gwas_genes, assess_gwas_genes_in_adata
gwas_genes = get_top_gwas_genes("systemic sclerosis", n=20)
gwas_context = assess_gwas_genes_in_adata(adata, gwas_genes, de_results=de_results)
```
**DO NOT write custom scoring code.** The `score_targets_simple()` function handles adaptive reweighting, convergence bonuses, cross-compartment L-R bridging, and NES-weighted pathway scoring. Custom scorers miss these and produce invalid priority tiers.

**VERIFICATION:** After 2f you MUST see: `"Target scoring complete! N targets scored, M HIGH, ..."`
After 2g: `"GWAS gene landscape: N genes mapped, M are DE in at least one cell type"`
**If DE returns 0 DEGs for a cell type:** DESeq2 auto-falls back to Wilcoxon. GSEA quality gate skips cell types with failed DE.
**If LIANA takes >15 min:** Normal for large datasets. Partial results saved at each step.

**Report structure:** The PDF report should have TWO target sections:
1. **Multi-omics targets** — DE-derived, scored across all evidence dimensions (from `score_targets`)
2. **GWAS gene landscape** — top SSc genetic targets mapped to cell types (from `assess_gwas_genes_in_adata`), showing which GWAS genes are expressed where and whether they're DE. This bridges the immune-fibroblast disconnect: GWAS targets (IRF5, STAT4) are immune genes, while DE targets are fibroblast genes. Both are real biology.

---

**Step 3 -- Generate visualizations:**
```python
from generate_visualizations import generate_all_plots
generate_all_plots(adata, de_results, pathway_results, lr_results,
                    genetic_results, scores, output_dir="results",
                    gwas_context_df=gwas_context)
```
**DO NOT write inline plotting code. This generates 11 standard visualizations including the GWAS gene landscape.**

**VERIFICATION:** You MUST see: `"All plots generated successfully! N visualizations saved"`
**If a plot fails:** Non-fatal -- other plots still generated. Check WARNING messages.

---

**Step 4 -- Export results:**
```python
from export_results import export_all
export_all(adata, de_results, pathway_results, lr_results,
            genetic_results, scores, output_dir="results")
```
**DO NOT write custom export code. Use export_all().**

**VERIFICATION:** You MUST see: `"=== Export Complete ==="`
**If you don't see "Export Complete":** The export did not complete. Re-run the export function.

## Target Scoring Methodology

See [references/target_scoring_methodology.md](references/target_scoring_methodology.md) for full details.

**Multi-omics composite score (convergent genetic + transcriptomic evidence):**

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Differential expression | 0.20 | -log10(padj) weighted by log2FC magnitude. Multi-cell-type DE bonus. |
| Pathway centrality | 0.15 | Disease-relevant enriched pathways containing the gene (FDR < 0.05). |
| L-R involvement | 0.15 | Consensus rank for disease-specific interactions. Reweighted to 0 if unavailable. |
| Cell-type specificity | 0.10 | Tau-like specificity of disease effect in disease-relevant cell types. |
| Genetic evidence | 0.25 | Open Targets GWAS/ClinVar (primary) + GeneBass + TWAS + eQTL + L2G. |
| Druggability | 0.15 | Open Targets tractability, known drugs, genetic constraint. |

**Convergence bonus (1.2x):** Targets with BOTH genetic AND transcriptomic evidence.

**Priority tiers:** HIGH (>=0.55), MEDIUM (0.35-0.55), LOW (<0.35)

**Adaptive reweighting:** If L-R or genetic evidence is unavailable, those weights are redistributed to remaining components (weights always sum to 1.0).

## Common Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ImportError: liana` | Not installed | `pip install liana` |
| `ImportError: decoupler` | Not installed | `pip install decoupler` |
| Pseudobulk DE blocked: N=1 | Single sample per condition | Need >=2 replicates. Fallback: cell-level Wilcoxon (exploratory) |
| DESeq2 degenerate results (all padj = 1.0) | Insufficient pseudobulk replicates for a cell type | Auto-falls back to Wilcoxon for that cell type. GSEA quality gate skips it. |
| GSEA skipped for a cell type | 0 significant DEGs (DE failure) | Expected -- GSEA on failed DE produces artifacts. Only runs on cell types with real signal. |
| GeneBass data not found | Not on Biomni datalake | Skill uses Open Targets GWAS/ClinVar as primary genetic evidence instead |
| No significant L-R interactions | Too few cell types or cells | Need >=3 cell types, >=10 cells per type. L-R weight redistributed in scoring. |
| LIANA takes >15 minutes | Large dataset with many cell types | Normal for >10K cells x 10+ cell types. Partial results saved at each step. |
| TWAS Atlas timeout | API issues | Retry with backoff (built-in). Falls back to other genetic evidence. |
| Open Targets rate limit | Too many gene queries | Built-in rate limiting (0.5s between requests) |
| SVG export failed | Missing svglite/cairocffi | Normal -- PNG always generated. Both created in most environments. |

**Expected warnings (not errors):**

| Warning | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| DESeq2 degenerate results, falling back to Wilcoxon | Cell type has too few samples for pseudobulk | Normal for subsampled data. Wilcoxon results are exploratory. |
| Skipping GSEA for [cell type] | DE failed for that cell type | GSEA quality gate working correctly. No action needed. |
| L-R consensus_rank is all NaN | liana version mismatch | Auto-falls back to specificity_rank. Scoring reweights. |

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Deep-dive on top targets** -- Use `genetic-target-hypothesis` for detailed genetic characterization of top-scored targets
2. **Trajectory analysis** -- Use `scrna-trajectory-inference` to trace disease progression in key cell types
3. **Regulatory networks** -- Use `grn-pyscenic` to identify TF regulators of disease programs
4. **Validation** -- Use `literature-review` to check published evidence for top targets
