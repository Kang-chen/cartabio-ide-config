## What TusoAI does

TusoAI is an agentic system for autonomous method development, catered towards computational biology but applicable to various fields. Given a code template or existing method and evaluation script, TusoAI coordinates agents to efficiently and autonomously evolve entire codebases thousands of times without human oversight, returning a higher performing version with new algorithmic and data innovations. TusoAI mimics a real computational biologist by mining literature and iteratively implementing, debugging, and evaluating improvements, while favoring simpler methods and retaining memory across iterations, powered by a custom-built agent harness that enables GPT-nano to efficiently edit codebases of arbitrary size.

Here are several advantages of TusoAI:
1. Iterates 100-200 times per every dollar spent, orders of magnitude more efficient than methods relying directly on Codex/Claude Code.
2. Explicitly models the task of data-searching, in which method developers need to discover what features/embeddings/priors from what data can be used to build powerful models.
3. Focuses on generating efficient, scalable, and diverse code optimizations, creating fundamentally new methods instead of small parameter tweaks.
4. Maintains history over 100's of iterations through a custom hierarchical feedback loop.

We have also integrated TusoAI directly into the Biomni ecosystem. Biomni is a general purpose biomedical agent that will autonomously iterate on the "meta-setup", which is the code, data, evals, and input to TusoAI. Biomni will monitor TusoAI, fix/update the setup, and return you a new method with strong performance. This integration makes such method development "code-free" and accessible to anyone purely through natural language.

## Instructions

TusoAI requires Python 3.10+ and is intended for a Unix-like environment (Linux recommended). Run it from the repository root so the local `tusoai` package is importable.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also install the dependencies required by your target repository, evaluation script, and data readers. Any additional packages available TusoAI can try and take advantage of, but won't install new packages. TusoAI is lightweight by design and is intended to be installed on top of your existing method development environment.

### 2. Configure credentials

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
# Optional, but recommended for higher-throughput literature search:
export SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY="..."
```

TusoAI supports `provider="openai"` and `provider="claude"`. When overriding `model_settings`, provide all three stages—`pdf`, `construction`, and `optimization`—each with a `model` and optional `thinking`, `thinking_tokens`, and `reasoning_mode`. The built-in settings use OpenAI models; Claude users must supply provider-compatible models for all three stages.

### 3. Prepare the evaluator

TusoAI runs `reference_filename` as a Python script with no arguments for every candidate. It must exit successfully and print a plain numeric score in this exact format:

```python
# eval_runner.py
from my_package.model import fit_model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    score = evaluate_model(fit_model)  # your validation evaluation
    print(f"tuso_evaluate: {float(score):.17f}")
```

Higher scores are better; to minimize a loss, print its negative value. The editable target may live in the evaluator or in another file supplied through `source_path` and `repo_root`. With `repo_root`, avoid hard-coded absolute import paths so imports resolve from TusoAI's temporary edited copy.

### 4. Create tasks and run TusoAI

A **method task** evolves algorithm/model logic using literature-derived ideas. A **data task** executes a local read command to profile a dataset and evolves a target that uses it, such as a feature-construction function. Multiple tasks can be optimized together.

```python
import os
from tusoai import Tusoai

ai = Tusoai.from_api_key(
    api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],
    provider="openai",
    # Optional: temperature=1.0, max_tokens=15000, model_settings={...}
)

task_description = "predicting the outcome of interest"
cache_dir = "tusoai_run"

method_task, method_cost = ai.create_method_subtask(
    function_name="fit_model",
    task_description=task_description,
    data_available="training features, labels, and a validation split",
    cache_dir=cache_dir,
    paper_searches=10,
    instruction_count=10,
    num_init=10,
    hints=["Keep the function signature and output shape unchanged."],
    source_path="my_package/model.py",  # omit if target is in eval_runner.py
    repo_root=".",
)

best_model, history = ai.optimize(
    method_tasks=[method_task],
    data_tasks=[],
    reference_filename="eval_runner.py",
    output_dir=cache_dir,
    task_description=task_description,
    TIME_LIMIT=60,   # minutes
    COST_LIMIT=10,   # estimated optimization cost in USD
    timeout=300,     # seconds per evaluation
    n_jobs=1,
)

print(best_model.accuracy)
print(best_model.code)
```

Optional data task:

```python
data_task, data_cost = ai.create_data_subtask(
    function_name="build_features",
    task_description=task_description,
    file_description="External annotations keyed by sample ID",
    data_usage="create additional numerical prediction features",
    read_cmd='df = pd.read_csv("data/annotations.csv")',
    # Or pass data_path="data/annotations.csv" to infer read_cmd.
    cache_dir=cache_dir,
    data_instruction_count=15,
    hints=["Do not change the number or order of rows."],
    source_path="my_package/features.py",
    repo_root=".",
)

# Then pass data_tasks=[data_task] to ai.optimize(...).
```

`function_name` may identify a top-level function, a class, or a scoped method such as `Model.fit`. Target names in a joint run should be unique.

## Main parameters

### Task construction

| Parameter | Use |
|---|---|
| `function_name` | Exact target to optimize. |
| `task_description` | Concise scientific/modeling objective. |
| `cache_dir`, `clear` | Reuse cached papers, summaries, instructions, and data profiles, or rebuild them. |
| `hints` | Constraints and implementation guidance for the target. |
| `source_path`, `repo_root` | Locate a target outside `reference_filename`; `repo_root` requires `source_path`. |
| `data_available` | Inputs available to a method task. |
| `num_cat`, `instruction_count`, `num_init` | Method-task idea categories, instructions, and initial implementations. |
| `paper_searches`, `info_per_paper` | Literature-search breadth and extracted information. |
| `file_description`, `data_usage` | What a data source contains and how it should be used. |
| `read_cmd` / `data_path` | Python read command, or a path from which TusoAI should infer one. |

### Optimization

| Parameter | Use |
|---|---|
| `reference_filename` | Evaluator that prints `tuso_evaluate: <score>`. |
| `TIME_LIMIT` | Total `optimize` wall-clock limit in **minutes**, including seeding. |
| `COST_LIMIT` | Estimated optimization LLM cost limit in USD; task-construction cost occurs before this. |
| `timeout` | Maximum seconds for each candidate evaluation. |
| `n_jobs` | Parallel workers; start with `1` and increase only if evaluations can run concurrently. |
| `max_islands` | Maximum diverse solution clusters retained during search. |
| `bug_retries`, `prompt_samples` | Code-repair attempts and task instructions sampled per mutation. |
| `drop_island_iter` | Minutes between reductions in the active island count. |
| `min_improvement` | Score difference treated as a meaningful improvement. |
| `load_history` | Previous `history.json` used to resume candidates and search state. |
| `memory_limit_gb` | Per-evaluation address-space limit. |
| `gpu_ids`, `cpu_threads_per_job` | Optional worker resource assignment. |
| `multi_machine` | Cooperate with other TusoAI processes through one shared history. Requires the same shared `output_dir` and non-empty `history_name` on every machine. |
| `sensitive_data` | Disables captured model diagnostics and adds a no-write constraint. |
| `debug` | Records and prints detailed prompt/evaluation diagnostics. |

`n_generations` and `children_per_model` remain in the API for compatibility but are not used by the continuous optimizer.

### Parallel and multi-machine execution

`n_jobs` controls worker processes on one machine. Set `cpu_threads_per_job`
explicitly when NumPy, BLAS, PyTorch, JAX, or the evaluator uses native threads;
otherwise nested parallelism can oversubscribe the host. `gpu_ids` are local to
each machine and are assigned to jobs round-robin.

`multi_machine=True` runs one independent optimizer process per machine while
sharing candidates and dynamic search state through a common history file. All
participants must use:

- the same task definitions, evaluator, source snapshot, dependency versions,
  `output_dir`, and non-empty `history_name`;
- a filesystem visible at the same absolute path from every machine and capable
  of cross-host directory creation plus atomic file replacement; and
- distinct local stdout/stderr logs and machine identifiers outside
  `history_name`.

Start one leader first. After it writes at least one valid candidate to the
shared `history.json`, start followers with the same configuration and
`load_history` pointing at that file. This avoids paying for duplicate seeding.
The optimizer creates a unique `code_<run-id>` workspace and per-run dev/prompt
logs for each process while appending candidate records to the shared history.

`TIME_LIMIT` and `COST_LIMIT` are limits for each Python process, not a cluster
budget. An external orchestrator must allocate per-node limits and stop or resume
nodes against a persisted global deadline/cost ledger.

## Outputs and resuming

TusoAI evaluates temporary copies and does not overwrite the original source tree. `best_model` contains the best `accuracy`, `runtime`, combined `code`, and per-target `functions`; review and apply the selected code to your project.

Logs are saved under `<output_dir>/history/history_<run-id>/` as `history.json`, `dev.json`, and `prompt_io.json`. Pass `history.json` to `load_history` to continue a run.
